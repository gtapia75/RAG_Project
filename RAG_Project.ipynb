Trapping in 9.5\\nseconds at 150 mph would make the ZR1 ZTK the third-fastest car we’ve ever\\ntested, behind only the 2024 Lucid Air Sapphire and the 2021 Tesla Model S Plaid,\\ntied with the 2022 Tesla Model S Plaid. That’s quicker than the SF90 Stradale\\nAsse\\x00o Fiorano, 296 GTB Asse\\x00o Fiorano, and LaFerrari, the next three quickest\\ncars through the quarter. More than that, it would make the ZR1 ZTK the quickest\\ncombustion-powered car we’ve ever tested. Even the standard ZR1 would come in\\nfourth, tied with the LaFerrari in elapsed time but posting a higher trap speed.\\nSee All 36 Photos\\n1/9/25, 10:48 PM 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 Claims BONKERS 0–60 Time!\\nhttps://www.motortrend.com/news/2025-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-0-60-mph-quarter-mile-time-claims/ 6/10',\n",
